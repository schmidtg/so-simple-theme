###We are on the list of Travel MB's top ten rural Festivals###

###We were featured in CAA MB's Magazine 2015 Spring Edition###

###We have been awarded a spot in the Top 100 Events in North America by the American Bus Association.###

The members of the Manitoba Highland Gathering strive to preserve, promote,
nurture, share and educate folk about our colourful Scottish Culture and
Heritage, Arts and Sports and Agriculture.

We are a non profit organization run exclusively by volunteers (youth to
senior) putting on an R.M. of St. Clements designated family fun filled out
door event with the rain venue on site.

If you are of the same mind set, come and join us so we can continue to be a
yearly event and be here for our future generations -- at least the next 50
years.

We welcome folks interested in working with us throughout the year and on the
days of the Gathering. We love what we do and have a good time doing it.
Shared jobs make the load much lighter, easier and more fun. Please call Joyce
at 204-794-6587 or email Sandra at communications@manitobahighlandgathering.org.

Be sure to bring your chairs and umbrellas as we happen rain or shine!! Some
of our events happen outdoors in the rain. If it rains some of the events will
join the environmentally sensitive vendor booths and the Regional Historical
Groups Exhibits and story tellers in the arena. Dancing will move to the
school.

### Press Release - 50th Manitoba Highland Gathering - June 2016###

The 50th Manitoba Highland Gathering will host for the first time ever, a  Heavy
Events competition pitting a team from Canada against a team from the USA.
Called the Battle of the Border, the July 2nd event will be held at East Selkirk
Legacy Park in East Selkirk.   Four Canadian athletes will compete against 4
American athletes in 7 classic Scottish events, including the caber toss, hammer
throw, Stone Put and Weight for Distance.  These events are precursors to modern
strongman competitions and to two Olympic track and field events (shot put and
hammer throw)

“We’ll have top athletes from  Wisconsin, Minnesota, Washington State, Alberta,
Saskatchewan and Ontario competing in a team format for the very first time at
the Manitoba Highland Gathering.   Our Gathering has always been a top draw for
elite Scottish throwers from all over North America, but we have never assembled
a more talented group of throwers for a single competition.  We figured the 50th
anniversary would be the ideal time to bring out the big guns and create a
competition that puts some national pride on the line” said MHG Vice-President
Jim Wilson.

Heading up the Canadian team will be 3 time Canadian Champ Jason Johnston,
holder of a number of Canadian records and who currently holds the World record
in the 16 lb. Sheaf Toss.   Captaining the US team is Luke Crowley who hails
from Wisconsin. Both are expected to put in strong showings on the day for their
teams and will challenge some provincial and even national records.
The competition is a one-day event beginning at 11AM on Saturday July 2nd and is
free with admittance to the Gathering itself.  An amateur Heavy Games
competition will be held on Sunday July 3rd featuring primarily local Scottish
athletes.
