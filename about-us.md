###We are on the list of Travel MB's top ten rural Festivals###

###We were featured in CAA MB's Magazine 2015 Spring Edition###

###We have been awarded a spot in the Top 100 Events in North America by the American Bus Association.###

The members of the Manitoba Highland Gathering strive to preserve, promote,
nurture, share and educate folk about our colourful Scottish Culture and
Heritage, Arts and Sports and Agriculture.

We are a non profit organization run exclusively by volunteers (youth to
senior) putting on an R.M. of St. Clements designated family fun filled out
door event with the rain venue on site.

If you are of the same mind set, come and join us so we can continue to be a
yearly event and be here for our future generations -- at least the next 50
years.

We welcome folks interested in working with us throughout the year and on the
days of the Gathering. We love what we do and have a good time doing it.
Shared jobs make the load much lighter, easier and more fun. Please call Joyce
at 204-794-6587 or email Sandra at communications@manitobahighlandgathering.org.

Be sure to bring your chairs and umbrellas as we happen rain or shine!! Some
of our events happen outdoors in the rain. If it rains some of the events will
join the environmentally sensitive vendor booths and the Regional Historical
Groups Exhibits and story tellers in the arena. Dancing will move to the
school.
