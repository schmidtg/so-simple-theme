**Change of Date Notice**

We have embraced this great exciting challenge to change dates to facilitate
Scot Dance MB, Scot Dance Canada and the Manitoba Highland Dancers Association.
This enables these associations the ability to offer two competitions for
traveling competitors from Britain, across Canada and the US when they travel to
Manitoba for the Scot Dance Canada Highland Dance Championship Series  July 6-10
in Winnipeg.   Manitoba has the honor to host the Championship Series every 10
years.
