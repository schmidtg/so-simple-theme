Due to lack of volunteers at the organizational level, The Manitoba Highland Gathering is unable to offer a solo or band pipe and drum competition this year.  We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.  Bands wil be invited to play a set for a $250 honorarium.  If you and/or your band would like to play at the Gathering, please contact Joyce Neyedly at joyce@manitobahighlandgathering.org.

If you would like to get involved with the Gathering in future years, please feel free to contact Joyce as well, we would love to have more involved members and volunteers.
